                A trip into the backcountry of Glacier National Park (glamping edition). We started at <mark>Sperry Chalet</mark>, a backcountry hut with beds, home-cooked meals, countless mountain goats, and pit toilets.

            Bear Country
            <br><br>
            Atleast 45% of my conversations this past month have been bear related. 
            <br><br>
            The bear saga: 
            <br>
            - A youtube viewing of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXY7_gSNrh4&ab_channel=OnlyGoodSHHH">Night of the Grizzlies</a> (to prepare for the trip, naturally) - 
            Two people were mauled and killed by two different grizzly bears, a quarter mile apart from each other, on the same night in 1967. 
            <br><br>
            - Several google searches on grizzly bear attacks to understand the actual risk. There have been 10 bear related fatalities in the history of the park since 1967.
            <br><br>
            - 5 different educational videos on how to use bear spray that all failed to reassure me. 
            <br><br>
            <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yell/learn/nature/bearspray.htm">The steps: </a><br>
            1. Remove the safety clip <i>(the bear would have already reached me)</i> <br>
2. Aim slightly down and adjust for crosswind <i>(takes atleast 30 seconds to confidently determine wind direction)</i><br>
3. Begin spraying when the charging bear is 30-60 feet away <i>(not sure average people have this frame of reference)</i> <br>
4. Spray at the charging bear so that the bear must pass through a cloud of spray <i>(im scared, the safety clip likely still isn't off)</i> <br>
5. Keep spraying until the bear changes direction <i>(ok)</i> <br>
6. If the bear continues to charge, spray into its face <i>(...)</i> <br>
7. Leave the area promptly 
            <br><br>

            Serious note: 
            Thankfully, we did not see any grizzly bears on any hike. I have seen several articles about hikers 
            who have been injured and killed in both Montana and Banff since coming home, which has been a very 
            scary and sad reminder of how important it is to be as safe and alert as possible. Be safe (!!!)
            
            <br><br>
            The most terrifying animal sighting on this trip occurred on <a href="https://www.alltrails.com">All Trails</a>. 
            We saw this posted for a trail in Canada the day before were planning on hiking it:

            on audio. By far, the best Harry Potter film.

            <br><br>
                Took a visit to Montana's famous Mongolian food joint - Hu Hut, and got food poisoning on day 1 of the trip. The ringing of a mini gong and the sound
                of two middle-aged grill chefs yelling "Huuuuuuu Hut" every time someone left a tip still haunts me.

            Some junior ranger facts for you:
            <br>
            - Glacier National Park had about 150 active glaciers when it was founded in 1910, it now has 25.
            <br>
            - Part of the Blackfeet Reservation was sold to the Federal government in 1895 and then became part 
            of Glacier National Park but many of the terms of the sale are disputed by both sides
            <br>
            - Drowning (not grizzly bears) are the number one cause of death in Glacier National Park.
          </li>
          <li> 
            Glacial swims - Took various dips in the only glacial lake we could handle, Lake MacDonald.
            No glacial swims were experienced in Canada as the water didn't warm up beyond 39 degrees Fahrenheit, and it's possible to get hypothermia after just 10-15 minutes of being in the water.            <br><br>

            A wonderful cafe/bookstore in Golden, British Columbia which provided us reprieve from our camping stint in Glacier National Park.
            Investigating the domain of Bacchus's godly expertise led us to the word 'bacchanal' (new vocab word for me).

                Bacchus - noun. (in ancient Greece and Rome) a god of wine and giver of ecstasy, identified with Dionysus
