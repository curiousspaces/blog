        <p class="description">hi, these are pieces I've created- some based off of existing works, and others i've conjured 
            up on my own. i am not fully sure what I want this space to be but for now sharing some color, shapes,
            and thoughts :)</p>

                The progression of drawing a scene from Royal Arch Trail in Chautaqua Park 
                - Boulder, Colorado. The arch reveals itself at the peak of the hike. 
                - I started with a pencil sketch to give myself some guidelines and then 
                dropped in the color. I like adding ink outlines over the watercolor for a 
                more sharp and abstract look. It also helps give a level of dimension that I 
                am unable to get with watercolor right now. (5.7.2022)

                The Narrows in Zion National Park, Utah. This hike runs through the narrowest section 
                of Zion Canyon. This has been my favorite hike that I have ever done. Looking through
                my cellphone camera roll, old photos of this hike always catch my eye. The walls and
                water of the gorge seem unreal as they glow and shimmer when the sun hits from
                different angles. I tried to capture that orange glow in the back wall of this watercolor.

                    This sketch is from a shikara ride on Dal Lake (Srinigar - Jammu and Kashmir, India). 
                    A shikara is a long wooden boat made of Himalayan cedar. Most tourist shikaras are decked out 
                    with colorful cushions, curtains, and paint. Some are also much larger and are used as house 
                    boats on the edge of the lake. 
                    <br>
                    My mom used to visit Kashmir every summer before college with her family and this was one of
                    her favorite experiences. I visited for the first time in April 2022 and couldn't miss the 
                    boat ride. I drew this small sketch for my mom. (4.23.2022)

                It was an assignment as part of drawing lessons I took when I was younger. An exercise 
                in shading and texture. It is based off a photograph of an old man’s eye with an eyebrow 
                that now does not seem bushy enough. (2013)</p>

        <p class="description">I painted both these pieces during the first year of Covid. I thought 
            it would be fun to try painting with acrylics on canvas. (It was not very fun or forgiving).
            I wanted to capture moments that make the world feel very still and make you feel very open.
            Getting lost in music that I enjoy or the moment when you dip below the surface of water in 
            the pool before swimming gives me this feeling. 
            Naming paintings seems too real and meaningful so I never have. But the one on the left I’d 
            name “High Fidelity” - it’s my version of Zoe Kravitz walking the streets of New York with 
            her headphones on. (2021)</p>
