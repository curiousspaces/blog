        <a href= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoVJKj8lcNQ>The AI dilemma</a> - 
        <p style="padding-bottom: 2px;">
        This talk was given at the <a href=https://www.humanetech.com/>Center of Humane Technology</a> by the creators of the documentary, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Social_Dilemma>The Social Dilemma</a>. 
        I wasn't particularly eager to watch this video because I feel a bit blasted with ChatGPT talk on a daily basis.
        But despite seeing an AI related headline in the news everyday, I don't think there has been enough emphasis on the implications of 
        this technology and how significantly it will change the world. It has been easy to marvel at how powerful it is, and then snap back to
        living everyday life without a second thought. 
        <br><br>
        This talk does a great job of explaining the phenomenon of AI in our time, and the dangers of how we are adopting and integrating some AI tools 
        into our everyday lives without much care. 
        Highly recommend watching this video (if not the whole thing, atleast the first 20-30 min).

        venturing a low confidence guess, and then pressing play- repeat for the duration of the whole episode.

        An advertisement for the <a href="http://www.mistakenorders.com/en/home.html">Restaraunt of Mistaken Orders</a> my father shared with me via a Tik Tok link... 
        <br><br>
        This pop up restaraunt in Japan has a waitstaff of people living with dementia. The restaraunt guarantee is
        that while you may not get what you ordered, you will walk away satisfied and happy.
        Cognitive decline and aging lend themselves to isolation. This heart warming initiative creates a space
        where the elderly can stay mentally and physically active in a safe community.

        <br><br>
        <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt16419074/">AIR</a> : 10/10. The unofficial sequel to Good Will Hunting. Matt Damon is not only a math genius but also a sports visionary.
        Ben Affleck starts out laying brick in Boston but eventually founds Nike and hires his old friend, Matt, to the Nike basketball division.
        Together they sign Michael Jordan and introduce the world to Air Jordan.

        <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3967856/">Okja</a> : This movie is from the director of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6751668/">Parasite</a>, Bong Joon-ho. Overall, a very unique movie that I think
        is worth the watch. It follows a young girl from South Korea as she tries to save her genetically modified super pig from 
        being slaughtered by an American corporation. This is a graphic, science fiction version of Charlotte's Web. 
        The movie hits on themes of animal rights, family, wealth, and capitalism and executes them all pretty well. 
        (7/10 - entertaining but wouldn't say it is a MUST watch)

        Ghost Writing Exposed:
        <br><br>
        I recently found out Prince Harry's memoir, Spare, was written by a ghost writer. This
        sent me down a spiral of investigating various celebrity memoirs to see where credit is actually due. 
        I assumed if there was a ghost, their presence would be a bit more obviously known. 
        <br><br>
        Some revelations: <br>
        - <i>Becoming</i> by Michelle Obama (and a team of ghost writers)<br>
        - <i>Dream of My Father</i> by Barack Obama (google is divided on whether there was a ghost writer)<br>
        - <i>I'm Glad My Mom Died</i> by Jennette McCurdy (no ghost writer!)<br>
        - <i>Born a Crime</i> by Trevor Noah (and ghost writer, Tanner Colby)<br>
        <br>
        I debated looking up Greenlights by Matthew McConaughey but I would rather live in the dark than not 
        give Matthew McConaughey all the credit.

        A <a href="https://www.donttellcomedy.com/cities/boston/">Don't Tell Boston </a>stand up comedy show in Central Square. The best comics were the ones with witty 
        crowd work- can't tell if I enjoy the stand up or it was just fun to watch people get picked on (consent was given).

        Monthly book review!
        <br><br>
        <b>Educated</b> by Tara Westover (5/5) : An absolutely insane memoir. I was late to reading this because I had thought
        there wouldn't be much special about a memoir about someone who fought for their education and was better for it.
        Tara's story is not one I could conjure up in my wildest dream (or nightmare). This book starts off slow but picks
        up very quickly and there is no lack of shock factor. 
        <br><br>
        <b>Song of Achilles</b> by Madeline Miller (4/5) : This is fast-paced, modern, and emotional retelling of Achilles
        hero's journey to the Trojan War. The story is based on the events in Homer's epic, The Illiad, but reads 
        nothing like an old classic tale. Dropped it down from 5 stars only because there were parts of Achilles's 
        love story that I felt got to be a bit repetitive.

        - A lovely <a href="https://yakultusa.com/">Yakult</a> + Sprite + Soju cocktail made by Pearl. <br>
        - Camelback Mountain and my first lizard sighting<br>
        - Lemons and oranges growing on the side of the road that may or may not be for the taking<br>
        - Walking off a cliff into an icy, cold pool of water after a long hike (I could not muster up 
        the courage to jump off.) <br>
