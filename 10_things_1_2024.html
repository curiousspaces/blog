            It's not 10 things, and it's not once a month, but I am here with a sporadic post about things that have occupied my time recently.

        I've recently graduated from a crochet hook to a sewing machine. Living in a hellscape of sleeves that are too short and pant legs that hit at the ankle, paired with encouragement from some crafty people, has helped make this transition possible. 
        <br>
        My goal is to be learn to make clothes that will last longer, and get more wear. 
        <br><br>
        Some beginner projects:

This street quiz show offers a contestant $5 for correctly guessing the artist of a song. Each correct answer offers a chance to go double or nothing by playing an additional round.
        It is gen z version of music Jeopardy with a commendable music selection.

        Reading:
        <br><br>
        <b>Stories by John Cheever</b> (Rating: 4/5)
        <br>
          John Cheever is a famous short story writer known for his work about the lives and morals of middle class suburbia in the 1900s (disturbia!). 
          This was a book club read that I didn't expect to enjoy as much as I did. Of the stories I read from this collection, most of them end in an unexpected flair. They unfold unassumingly until the end, where a subtle revelation piques the reader's curiosity. This development is intriguing enough to prompt delving into another short story to explore where it might lead.
          <br>
          His most popular short story is <a href=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1964/07/18/the-swimmer">The Swimmer</a> but these were a few favorites of mine:
          <ul>
          <li style="padding: 2px;"><a href="https://tnsatlanta.org/wp-content/uploads/The-Enormous-Radio-Cheever.pdf">The Enormous Radio</a></li>
          <li style="padding: 2px;"><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1954/04/10/the-five-forty-eight">The Five-Forty-Eight</a></li>
          <li style="padding: 2px;"><a href="https://www.npsd.k12.nj.us/cms/lib04/NJ01001216/Centricity/Domain/82/The%20Country%20Husband.pdf">The Country Husband</a></li>
          </ul>
          <br><br>
      <b>Remains of the Day</b><br>
      This one starts slow, immersing the reader in a comprehensive assesment of life as a 1920s English butler. Over the course of the novel, the author subtley ties together different threads to analyze themes of identity, nobility, and dignity.
      Admittedly, much of the nuance and deeper ideas of the book were lost on me until I reached the end of the novel (and watched the movie, which I highly recommend).
      It took me a bit to decide what I thought about this one, but by the end of it, a solid 5/5.

        Viking Chess: 
        Ikea is not the only gem to come out of Sweden; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubb">Kubb</a> is a lawn/beach game that involves two teams knocking down their opponents' wooden blocks by throwing wooden dowels at them. Once all the opponents' blocks have fallen, the team must topple the king piece.
        Legend claims vikings used to play the game with the bones of their fallen enemies, and now, I hope it rivals Bocce at retirement homes across the United States.

        This channel is significantly better than much of primetime television.

          <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11173006/">Super Pumped: The Battle for Uber</a> - <br><br>
            A seven episode television series based on a <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/super-pumped-mike-isaac/1131004588">book</a> with the same title by Mike Isaac. This TV series casts <a href="https://superhero-films.fandom.com/wiki/Robin_(Joseph_Gordon-Levitt)">Robin</a> (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Taylor_(Friday_Night_Lights)">Coach Taylor</a> (Kyle Chandler), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bride_(Kill_Bill)">The Bride</a> (Uma Thurman), and a few other big stars to explain the dramatic and controversial events surrounding the rise of Uber, and Travis Kalanick's CEO arch in particular.

            I find it difficult to determine the accuracy of 'docudramas,' but this one seemed reliable. Certain characters felt a bit like caricutures but the show was well-made and very interesting.

        <a href="Bourdieu's theory of taste">Bourdieu's theory of taste</a>: 
          A substack article summarizing Pierre Bourdieu’s 1979 book, Distinction: a social critique of the judgement of taste by <a href="https://dynomight.substack.com/">dynomight</a>. 

          This study in sociology explains a theory of how personal tastes both influence and are predicted by social class and how the relationship between these two things incentivizes people to align with tastes that represent a certain class.
          <br><br>
          Some loose thoughts if you read the post: 
          <ul>
            <li style="padding: 2px;">It is so easy to imitate taste in an online, media consumed world. Differentiating original thought/opinion is increasingly difficult</li>
            <li style="padding: 2px;">The hypothesis on tastes applies similarly to when people talk about morals/ethics/politic socially. There is definitely a local maxima benefit to signaling certain social beliefs.</li>
            <li style="padding: 2px;">This theory is interesting and helpful when analyzing in larger trends</li>   
            <li style="padding: 2px;">Deciphering signal/countersignal and intention on an individual level is an interesting introspective exercise but going too meta on it is futile</li>   
        </ul> 
    </li>
